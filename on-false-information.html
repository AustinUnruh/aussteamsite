	<p id="indent">Part of being human is not being perfect and making mistakes. Being arrogant is unscientific, real science requires humility and a lack of presumption or hypocracy.
		To that end anyone who engages in science and research needs to be held accoutable when they make mistakes and they need to correct those mistakes. Responsibility
		and accountability are paramount to science or really any field. Without responsibility and accountability trust breaks down, negative rumors abound, and projects get ruined.
		That means choosing to change when you find out you're wrong. I will not claim to be perfect as I have occationally written presumptuous false information on here, but when
		I find I'm wrong I will do my best to correct the false information and help improve the accuracy of other's understanding as well when they are mistaken. It is each
		individual's responbility to accept accountability for their actions although having trusted friends who check eachother is very helpful too. You need to have the bravery
		to fail and pay for failures you caused that means not lying to yourself and others and remaining honest even in the face of guilt. If this does not happen, harms will be
		caused and great projects and people will be ruined.
