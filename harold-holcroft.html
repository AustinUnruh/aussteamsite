		<p id="indent">Sir Nigel Gresley is most often believed to be the inventor of <a class="steampunk" href="conjugated-valve-gear.html">conjugated valve gear</a>.
			The truth is conjugated motion for use on locomotives was reinvented by Harold Holcroft. The first conjugated gear ever to exist was invented by
			David Joy for three cylinder maritime engines, but Holcroft created his without any prior knowledge of Joy's. Gresley understood the potential
			of conjugated motion. Gresley did invent the 2 to 1 lever set and worked with Harold Holcroft to incorporate it into his most famous loco designs.
			Holcroft also wrote an autobiography titled
			<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Locomotive_Adventure.html?id=l-0MAQAAIAAJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Locomotive Adventure</i></a>
				with two volumes. I've read the first volume and highly recommend it for
			anyone who is interested in locomotive engineering history.</p>
			<p id="indent"><a href="https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/documents/aa110080958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harold's papers</a>
			were donated by one of his grandchildren to the British National Railway Museum and can be found
			<a href="https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/documents/aa110080958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
