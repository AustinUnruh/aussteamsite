		<p id="indent">When Charles Heisler was filing his locomotive patent in 1897 he made sure to include a V4 variant of the engine. This engine has a crank angle of 180° and a
		bank angle of 90° to give near perfect balance which is not achievable with the standard V-twin engine and would have made it exceptional compared to a lot of shays which
		didn't even have any balancing weights.</p>

		<p id="indent">Each bank has piston phases that are 180° appart. This allows for one valve gear with a rocking bar extension to be
		used for each piston bank like

		With this arrangement compounding is possible although much more design work is required
		to make it ideal. Because it has perfect balance and increased power in a compact form factor a V4 engine is the ideal type for a Heisler.</p>
		
		<p id="indent"> Unfortunately, we don’t have any documentation to prove this locomotive design was ever built.
		A G-gauge model has been made which proves the principles of the engine work.</p>
