			Axles Pumps have never been used on full sized designs. They would add extra ballast and moving parts but in exchange suffer from less wear on them sue to a shorter travel.

		A Bifurcation in a rod is a divergence of one rod into two branching rods that re-converge before the
		whole rod terminates. This creates a gap through which other components namely axles can fit so the rod can freely move without fouling on them.</p>

		<p id="indent">A bifurcation is undesirable because it reduces the strength of the rod, but if one must be used it is more acceptable to use one on an
		eccentric rod, because the stresses on eccentric rods are much less severe than on a connecting rod.</p>

	<p id="indent">Bifurcated eccentric rods have

	<p id="indent">Bifurcated connecting rods were used in select few balanced American compound designs. It's plain to see just by looking at them that they're not as strong as they should be
	 and are thus liable to break while in use.</p>
