		<h3>Myth:</h3>
		<p id="indent">
			It is claimed by a select few sources that coal fired steam locomotives are banned in California.
			It was claimed on
			<a href="https://locomotive.fandom.com/wiki/Union_Pacific_No._4466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Union Pacific 4466's wiki page</a>
			which I have since revised</p>
		
		<h3>Truth:</h3>
		<p id="indent">While there may be truth to that claim the true restrictions are more complex.
			There has never been an outright ban on coal or solid fuel fired steam locomotive tourist operations in California.
			Emissions regulations are applicable if a locomotive is to be used commercially, but historic railroads get a low
			use exemption.
		</p>
		<p id="indent">Thanks to the
			<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Air Resources Board</a>
			for clearing up the misunderstanding.</p>
		<p id="indent">It is notable that as of 3-14-2024
			<a href="https://locomotive.fandom.com/wiki/Nevada_Central_No._2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Nevada</a>
			is being restored to operation at the
			<a href="https://socalrailway.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern California Railroad Museum</a>
			and will be fired using coal.
