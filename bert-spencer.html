		<p id="indent">Bert Spencer has been an enigmatic figure within steam locomotive engineering history. Very little has been widely known about
		his life other than the work he did under 
			<a href="https://www.lner.info/eng/gresley.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sir Nigel Gresley</a>
			. He was very introverted and took none of the limelight for himself, leaving it
		all to Gresley. He was the
			<a class="steampunk" href="conjugated-valve-gear.html">Conjugated Valve Gear</a>
			specialist on Gresley's engineering team. He was a primary participant in Gresley's pacific projects being responsible for such important
			features as the Corridor tender and the introduction of long lap valves to the A1s onward.</p>
		<p id="indent">Thankfully a biography about him has finally been published (12th September 2023). You can purchase the biography
