		A Bifurcation in a rod is a divergence of one rod into two branching rods that re-converge before the
		whole rod terminates. This creates a gap through which other components namely axles can fit so the rod can freely move without fouling on them.</p>

		<p id="indent">A bifurcation is undesirable because it reduces the strength of the rod, but if one must be used it is more acceptable to use one on an
		eccentric rod, because the stresses on eccentric rods are much less severe than on a connecting rod.</p>

	<center><h2>Eccentric</h2></center>
	<p id="indent">Bifurcated eccentric rods have
		been used on the Hackworth gear of the

	<center><h2>Connecting Rod</h2></center>
	<p id="indent">Bifurcated connecting rods were used in select few balanced American compound designs. It's plain to see just by looking at them that they're not as strong as they should be
	 and are thus liable to break while in use. They should not be used and cylinder offsets, clearance cranks, or dividing the drive should be used in their place.</p>

	<!-- <p id="indent">A Bifurcated rod was also used on the Great Eastern Railway Decapod 0-10-0 one off locomotive. The design of this connecting rod is slightly better
	because it doesn't have bends in the structural elements. This was possible because the engine also made use of a clearance crank in combination.</p>
