		<p id="indent">I initially believed that the apparatus installed on top of this loco was an air cooled condenser. However after further research I learned that this is actually
			a heat exchanger. It preheats intake air before it enters the firebox using waste heat from the exhaust. It's a heat recirculator just like a feed water heater.
			Judging by the fact that it was only equiped on one example of the 80 series which was otherwise very successful, it's reasonable to guess that it was not
			as effective as a feed water heater. This follows with the fact that air is a poor conveyer of heat compared to water. The addition of bends in the chimney most
			definitely increase the back pressure in the cylinders and reduce drafting efficiency. Drafting efficiency is the most important type behind cylinder efficiency
			in a steam locomotive, so features that reduce drafting efficiency need to have a really good benefit to justify introduction and this preheater certainly doesn't.

			A hydrostatic , unlike a mechnical lubricator, hydrostatic lubricators have no active moving parts, just manual valves that control it.
			My personal opinion is that the mechnical lubricator is ever so slightly better. This is because it doesn't draw power from live steam to operate meaning less direct power
			draw from the boiler and less holes is the boiler to reduce steam tightness and less steam pipe area, it has less points
			of contact to  but the differences in the merits between the two are so negligable
			you could choose either or and have no reason to worry as long as direct injection of oil to the cylinder and valve liners is implemented. Porta used hydrostatic lubricators
			on the Rio Turbio 2-10-2s and said the debate between the two types was needless what really matters is how the oil is injected into the cylinders.
