		<p id="indent">As far as I am aware the
			<a href="http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/holcroft/holcroft.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holcroft-Anderson recompression locomotive</a>
			was the first and only tested attempt to integrate
		a powerplant mechanical vapor recompression system into a steam locomotive. Although the life of the experimental locomotive was cut short,
		it's limited success convinced
			<a class="steampunk" href="harold-holcroft.html">Harold Holcroft</a>
			that further development of the system should be pursued. The original inventor H. P. H. Anderson
		had died in 1938, the Steam Heat Conservation Co. dissolved in 1939, and the patent rights had been allowed to expire. This left Holcroft as
		the only individual with the knowledge necessary to recreate the system. When in discussions with
			<a href="https://www.lner.info/eng/bulleid.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oliver Bulleid</a>
			between 1942-1944 Holcroft brought the
			recompression system experiments to his attention. Bulleid judged the system as practical, baring the draft inducing fan,
			and authorized Holcroft to begin preliminary design work on an improved recompression system to be fitted to the new Pacifics.</p>
		<p id="indent">In my opinion this is the work that should have been undertaken by Bulleid on a normal locomotive to satisfy his desire
			to innovate over the pacifics and leader.</p>
		<p id="indent">The details of the design work done are documented on pages 168-173 of
		<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Locomotive_Adventure.html?id=l-0MAQAAIAAJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Locomotive Adventure Vol. 1</i></a>.</p>
